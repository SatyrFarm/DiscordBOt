We Want to Really be Open and Fair, so we want to make sure we credit [UnOfficialNode.js Discord Server Bot](https://github.com/UnofficialNodejsDiscord/Unofficial-Node.js-Discord-Bot) which we based the 3.0.0 Version and forward off of. We used it and added our commands to it, we take no credit for commands they had on it before we used it.
